# simple-guessnumber-game
This is a simple guessnumber game developed with python.
First, i import the function random to enable the pc to choose any number from 0 to 20. Then, i define the function game(), inside it i established the input to write my guess number and then the condition will run. Finally, considering my answer, the game will give me feedback if my number is higher or lower than the number choosed by the pc. 
You can try to guess 6 times, and that is with i call the function game() x6. Enjoy
